### Louisiana Micreauxbreweries

#### Abstract
Louisiana Micreauxbreweries is an app for beer enthusiasts who live in the great state of Louisiana and would like to browse the different microbreweries around their state. The app gives the user the ability to select a brewery that interests them to get details about the brewery, and also allows them to save/favorite any brewery of their choice. They are able to navigate to their favorites page at any time to see all of the breweries they have saved.
